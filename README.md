# Eye-Exercise
Project Title: Eye Exercise

Description of Project:  When provided with one eye that tracked with mouse movement, I created a second, identical eye that tracked synchronously with the initial eye.

How to Run: Upon loading index.html, the pupils will track with movement of the mouse.

Roadmap of Future Improvements:  Upon click, additional eyes will be added, maintaining the function of pupil movement with movement of the mouse.
